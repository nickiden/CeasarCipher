# CeasarCipher
This program is based on the CS50 Cipher game. It is modified to not use the CS50 library.

How this program works:

  1. The user enters two commandline arguments eg// cipher.exe 10. The first argument is the file name .exe and the second
     is the key value for the cipher.
  
  2. THe program will validate the Command Line Arguments. Is there 2 and is the 2nd a number
  
  3. The user is prompted to enter a phrase to change.
  
  4. If the phrase is a valid phrase the letters are switched based on the key number entered.
  
  5. The code is then printed out to the user.
  
  I wrote this program to modify the CS50 version found in EdX. They use a custom library to get string. I changed it to use a fgets
  to get string.
